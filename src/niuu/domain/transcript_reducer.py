"""Shared pure transcript reducer — the SINGLE folding contract (SRD FR-3 / INV-4).

There used to be two independent implementations of "fold frames into conversation
turns": the LIVE one in ``skuld.broker._handle_cli_event`` (incremental, frame-by-frame
as deltas stream) and the REBUILD one in ``volundr...transcript_rebuild.rebuild_turns``
(batch, over the whole durable log). They drifted — different turn-id policy, different
reasoning ordering, different metadata key names — and a UI reading ``metadata.usage`` got
nothing back from a rebuilt turn. There was no parity test pinning them together.

This module is the one place the per-frame STATE TRANSITION lives. A single frame mutates a
:class:`TurnAccumulator`; flushing the accumulator produces a turn dict. The two paths drive
the SAME transitions:

  * the LIVE path applies them one frame at a time as frames arrive (broker keeps its own
    streaming/broadcast side-effects, but the turn it *builds* comes from here);
  * the REBUILD path applies them across the full ordered list (``reduce_frames``).

Identical transitions over the same frames ⇒ identical resulting turns ⇒ INV-4 holds by
construction.

niuu is the correct home: both ``skuld`` and ``volundr`` already import ``niuu``, and a pure
reducer here avoids deepening the skuld↔volundr coupling. This module imports NOTHING from
``volundr`` or ``skuld`` (module-boundaries rule) — it takes duck-typed frame objects.

## Unified turn-id policy (chosen ONCE here)

  * assistant / synthesised turns: ``uuid5(_TURN_NAMESPACE, "{session_id}:{seq}:{role}")``
    where ``seq`` is the durable-log seq of the LAST frame folded into the turn. Deterministic
    so repeated rebuilds are byte-identical (no flicker for polling clients), AND the live path
    uses the same seq (its ``_event_log_seq`` at flush time) so live id == rebuilt id for the
    same logical turn.
  * user turns: the human turn's own id/uuid when the frame carries one (the live broker mints
    a uuid4 ``msg_id`` and writes it into BOTH the ``user`` frame's ``uuid`` and the
    ``user_confirmed`` frame's ``id``); otherwise the deterministic seq-based id. Using the
    carried id means live and rebuild agree on the user-turn id without coordination.

## Unified metadata schema (chosen ONCE here)

  ``{usage, cost, model}`` (the names the UI reads), plus optional ``stop_reason``, ``status``
  (``interrupted`` / ``error``) and ``provenance`` (``terminal_scrape``). Failed results also
  retain ``is_error``, ``error`` and ``messageType: "error"`` so a transport failure cannot
  masquerade as a successful completion after reload. The old rebuild-only
  ``modelUsage`` key is gone — it is normalised to ``usage`` here. There is deliberately NO
  ``source`` provenance tag: metadata must be path-IDENTICAL (live == rebuild) for INV-4, and a
  "which path produced this" marker cannot be both meaningful and identical across paths.

#
# Per-tool wall-clock, stamped onto the CONVERSATION WIRE so a client can say "ran in 3m 12s"

# text→tools turn would report the SAME whole-run span on every burst inside it.

#   * ``tool_use``    part → ``started_at``, ``ended_at``, ``duration_ms``
#   * ``tool_result`` part → ``ended_at``
# ALL THREE client-facing values ride the tool_use part on purpose: it is the block that
# survives shallow elision by ``{**block}`` spread, and the one ForgeKit already decodes into
# a typed struct. The tool_result stamp is the orphan-safe fallback (a result whose call was
# in an already-flushed turn still reports when it landed).
#
# Every key is ADDITIVE and OMITTED ENTIRELY when unknown: a frame with no timestamp produces
# the exact byte-identical part dict it produced before D1, so a stored transcript, an old
# broker, and a client that never learned these keys are all unaffected.
#
# Honest semantics: "started" = when the broker OBSERVED the tool_use frame, "ended" = when it
# observed the tool_result. On the tmux/Claude plane those come from PreToolUse/PostToolUse
# hooks (millisecond-accurate boundaries); on SDK/streaming transports a message's tool_use
# blocks arrive together, so parallel calls report overlapping windows. This is wall-clock
# observation latency, NOT CPU time. A transport that knows better may stamp ``started_at`` /
# ``ended_at`` on the raw block itself — the reducer prefers a block-carried stamp over the
# frame ts, so hook-exact timing is a one-line transport change later.

# re-deriving turns from raw frames — but the live broadcast NEVER emits them. The

# exclude these so literal frame-for-frame equality holds (live == replay == cold).
# This is NOT a visibility concern (independent of ``show_internal``); it is the set

# A LIVE client sees exactly ONE such pair — its own. But the durable log
# accumulates one pair PER historical connect (each logged with fresh seqs, INV-1
# superset preserved), so a cold-read or replay-as-live tail would re-stream every
# historical handshake and a reconnected session's read paths would surface
