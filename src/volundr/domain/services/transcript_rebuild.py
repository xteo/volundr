"""Transcript rebuild — fold the durable event log into renderable conversation turns.

BUG-2 fix: a tmux-interactive Forge session that crashes mid-turn (WS dies while the
agent is blocked on AskUserQuestion) reloads as an empty "dead" session even though
hundreds of frames are durably persisted in ``session_event_log``. The conversation read
path historically rebuilt turns ONLY from ``kind == "conversation.turn"`` rows (the SDK
happy path), so a tmux/crash session — whose work survives as raw ``terminal_frame`` /
``assistant`` / ``content_block_delta`` / ``result`` frames — returned nothing.

SRD FR-3 / INV-4: this module is the BATCH driver of the ONE shared reducer
(``niuu.domain.transcript_reducer``). The live broker fold and this rebuild both apply the
SAME per-frame transitions — the live path incrementally as frames stream, this path across
the whole ordered list — so a log replay folds byte-identically to what streamed live (under
one turn-id policy + one metadata schema). There is no second folding implementation: the
divergence in turn-id policy, reasoning ordering, and metadata key names is gone.

This stays a PURE domain helper — no I/O, no ``skuld`` imports — called only by
``SessionArchiveService._load_event_log_transcript``.

Data-safety contract (see the Bug-2 spec §8):
  * Fallback-only: the caller runs this only after live/archive sources are empty.
  * No write-back: never mutates ``message_count`` (the /usage path is the single writer).
  * No double-count: ``conversation.turn`` rows are authoritative; raw frames that share a
    saved turn's ``request_id`` (or a human turn's ``uuid``) are skipped — this neutralises
    the seed double-log (the same human turn written as BOTH a conversation.turn AND a raw
    ``user`` frame with the same uuid), AND the Epic-A ``user`` + ``user_confirmed`` pair.
  * Ordering: strictly by ``entry.seq`` (the outer log seq), never ``payload["seq"]``.
  * Idempotent: rebuilt/interrupted turn ids are ``uuid5(session_id, seq, role)`` so
    repeated reloads produce byte-identical turns (no flicker for polling clients).
  * Partial turns: assistant work with no terminating ``result`` (the incident) is flushed
    at end-of-stream as one assistant turn flagged ``metadata.status="interrupted"``.
