"""INV-4 fold-parity: the LIVE incremental fold == the BATCH rebuild over the durable log.

This is the test the SRD (§7 INV-4, §6 FR-3) makes load-bearing: there must be ONE folding
contract. We drive the SAME logical frame sequence two ways —

  (a) INCREMENTALLY through the live broker's ``_handle_cli_event`` (frame-by-frame, the way
      deltas stream), capturing both the resulting ``_conversation_turns`` AND the durable
      ``_event_log_buffer`` the broker persisted; and
  (b) in BATCH through ``volundr...transcript_rebuild.rebuild_turns`` over those EXACT persisted
      entries —

and assert the two turn lists are EQUAL (ids, content, parts ordering, metadata). Because both
paths now drive the shared ``niuu.domain.transcript_reducer`` transitions, equality holds by
construction. The cases below include the Epic-A ``user`` + ``user_confirmed`` dedup and an
interrupted/partial (crash-mid-turn) turn.
