"""End-to-end NUL-byte tolerance proof: forge producer → durable log → Volundr PG.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Volundr's /log persistence path used to 500 on NUL bytes. Agent output (crash
dumps, hang-detector listings, raw terminal bytes) regularly contains the NUL
code point (U+0000). ``json.dumps`` escapes it to the valid JSON sequence
``\\u0000``, but a PostgreSQL JSONB column CANNOT store that escape — asyncpg
raises ``UntranslatableCharacterError``. Because the write paths use
``executemany``, a single poisoned frame failed the WHOLE batch, so every frame
in it was dropped and sessions looked frozen while the agent was still working.

The authoritative fix + its unit/integration proof live with the outbound
adapters (``src/volundr/adapters/outbound/_jsonb.py`` and the
``tests/test_adapters`` / ``tests/integration/volundr`` suites owned by the
adapter agent). THIS file is COMPLEMENTARY producer-side coverage: it proves the
forge tmux producer can EMIT binary (NUL-bearing) content, that the binary frame
survives into the broker's durable event log without crashing the producer, that
``rebuild_turns`` tolerates it, and — the payoff — that the harness-shaped
``SessionLogEntry`` list PERSISTS through a REAL Volundr ``PostgresSessionEventLog``
against real PostgreSQL and round-trips back out.

Honest scoping: the tmux/broker tests below are producer-side (no Volundr backend
in the loop). The real-PG persistence proof (``test_*_persists_to_real_pg*``) is
the genuine end-to-end seam and is the part that would have caught the 500.

All tests are ``@pytest.mark.integration`` (the default pytest addopts deselect
them) and the tmux ones skip when tmux is unavailable.

NUL CONSTRUCTION
----------------
Every NUL byte in this file is built at runtime via ``chr(0)`` — NEVER a literal
NUL in the source (a literal NUL is exactly the bug; it would corrupt the file).
