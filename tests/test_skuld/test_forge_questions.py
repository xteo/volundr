"""Scenario Group E — ask_user_question in tmux (the user-reported breakage).

Every tmux scenario here drives a REAL ``skuld.broker.Broker`` wired to a REAL
``TmuxInteractiveTransport`` running ``fakeagent`` inside tmux, with an in-process
fake browser client. They lock the CLI-mode questions bridge end to end — the
path the user reported as broken ("the question is not sent to the frontend in
tmux"):

  * E1 — an ``ask:`` surfaces a structured ``ask_user_question`` frame to the
    client (request_id + questions[].options) AND the broker tracks it in
    ``_pending_ask_user_questions`` for reconnect replay. Proves the question DOES
    reach the frontend. E1b asserts the ``awaiting_input`` state flip separately —
    this exposed a real bug (the tool_use frame's ``active`` report clobbered
    ``awaiting_input``); now fixed in the broker and guarded against regression.
  * E2 — answering the NON-default option translates to the right digit: the
    bridge reads the live menu, ``_match_menu_digit`` picks the matching row, the
    digit+Enter keystroke is typed, the agent receives that choice, and
    ``ask_user_resolved`` carries the chosen label.
  * E3 — menu-not-yet-rendered RACE (was a real product bug): with the menu
    rendered ~0.4s AFTER the hook, answering immediately used to capture an EMPTY
    menu and blindly press "1"+Enter (the default). The bridge now bound-polls the
    live menu before pressing the chosen digit; this test guards that fix.
  * E4 — multiSelect: a multi-option answer. The tmux bridge only translates the
    FIRST chosen option (one digit + Enter) — a documented limitation of the
    keystroke bridge (no per-option space-toggle). xfail(strict).
  * E5 — the Deny path sends ``Escape`` (not a digit) and resolves ``deny``.
  * E6 — SDK<->tmux parity (credential-free): the SAME logical question through the
    SDK transport (fake client) and through tmux emits an ``ask_user_question``
    frame with the same structural shape and the same ``ask_user_resolved`` /
    resolve contract. Drift is documented.
  * E7 — turn end clears a stale prompt: an unanswered question, then the turn
    ends → the pending tty prompt is resolved+cleared and not replayed later.

The tmux scenarios are @pytest.mark.integration (default addopts deselect them)
and skip when tmux is unavailable. Run them on the real-tmux tier:

    SKULD__TMUX_REMOTE_CONTROL=0 uv run pytest -m integration \
        tests/test_skuld/test_forge_questions.py -p no:cacheprovider -q -rs

E6's SDK half and E1/E7 unit-style assertions run on the default tier.
