"""Scenario Group D — CRASH & RECONNECT (forge tmux harness).

These exercise the broker's durability + reconnect-replay contracts against a
REAL tmux session driving ``fakeagent``:

  * D1 — client crash mid-turn -> reconnect: the in-flight turn survives the WS
    death and the NEW client sees the assistant state + the turn completing.
  * D2 — crash WITH a question open -> reconnect re-surfaces the answerable
    ask_user_question (tmux lock-state guard), the new client answers it, and the
    agent unblocks (ask_user_resolved). HIGHEST value.
  * D3 — agent crash mid-turn -> the durable event-log rebuilds a partial,
    ``metadata.status=="interrupted"`` assistant turn with deterministic uuid5
    ids stable across two rebuilds (Bug 2).
  * D4 — (default tier, pure reducer) authoritative conversation.turn rows win
    over overlapping raw frames sharing a request_id (no double-count).
  * D5 — reconnect does NOT re-surface an ALREADY-answered question.
  * D6 — (best-effort) conversation endpoint fallback to the rebuilt log; left as
    a documented xfail rather than a fragile Postgres-wired test.

Integration tests drive real tmux and are deselected by the default addopts;
run with ``-m integration`` and ``SKULD__TMUX_REMOTE_CONTROL=0``.
