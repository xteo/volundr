"""INV-7 delivery integrity for correlated, durably claimed user messages.

Definite native refusals may retry under the same durable claim. Ambiguous
provider outcomes remain pending and are exercised in test_broker_review_regressions.

The delivery-integrity invariant is already pinned at two other tiers:

  * the REDUCER tier — ``test_transcript_reducer_parity.py::test_parity_delivery_state_failed``
    proves ``reduce_frames`` reconstructs ``steering_state=failed`` from the durable log;
  * the REST tier — ``test_rest.py`` proves a logged ``user_delivery_failed`` surfaces as a 502.

What was NOT pinned anywhere is the seam between them: the LIVE BROKER, when a bounded retry
TERMINALLY fails, must (a) write ``user_delivery_failed`` to the durable buffer FIRST and only
then broadcast it (the INV-1 superset ordering, for THIS frame kind, exercised against the real
``_emit_broker_frame`` choke point — the existing INV-7 retry tests mock ``_channels.broadcast``
and never enable the durable buffer, so they cannot observe append-before-broadcast); and (b)
leave the durable log in a state from which the user turn's delivery lifecycle reconstructs to
``pending -> failed`` via ``steering_state_from_frame`` — never stuck ``pending`` and never
``delivered``.

The assertions here are non-tautological: the broadcast-ordering check captures the buffer
contents AT broadcast time (an independent observation of "was it appended first"), and the
steering reconstruction is derived by an independent walk of the logged frames through
``steering_state_from_frame`` AND cross-checked against the shared ``reduce_frames`` rebuild —
the expectation is never compared against the same fold twice.

This box leaks ``SKULD__*``/``VOLUNDR*`` env that poisons ``SkuldSettings``; this file lives
under ``tests/test_skuld`` so ``tests/test_skuld/conftest.py`` autouse-strips them, but we also
build settings explicitly (no env-derived fields) to be belt-and-suspenders safe.
