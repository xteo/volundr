"""Scenario Group B — STEERING / restart (broker + real-tmux tier).

Every test here drives a REAL ``skuld.broker.Broker`` wired to a REAL
``TmuxInteractiveTransport`` running ``fakeagent`` inside tmux, exercising the
native-steering inbound path end to end:

  * B1 — an idle browser message starts EXACTLY one turn (one ``result``).
  * B2 — a mid-turn steer keeps the in-flight turn alive (no restart, no second
    ``result`` for the one ``work`` turn), delivers the steer text
    (``terminal_input_sent`` + ``user_delivered`` ACK), and refreshes the idle
    clock.
  * B3 — a wedged ``_send_lock`` (a stuck prior delivery) is BOUNDED: a steer
    surfaces a loud ``user_delivery_failed`` within ~``_deliver_timeout_s``
    rather than deadlocking.
  * B4 — steering AFTER a WS crash + reconnect (Bug 3): the ACK with the matching
    ``request_id`` reaches the NEW client and the agent actually received the
    text (``terminal_input_sent`` on the pane).
  * B6 — ordering under burst: 5 rapid messages during a ``work`` turn deliver in
    order (send-lock serialization) and each is ACKed.

All are @pytest.mark.integration (the default pytest addopts deselect them) and
skip when tmux is unavailable. Run them on the real-tmux tier:
